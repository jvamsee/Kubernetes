Step 1: Set up Terraform with AWS
The first thing to set up is your Terraform. We will create an AWS IAM users for Terraform.

In your AWS console, go to the IAM section and create a user named “FullAccess”. Then add your user to a group named “FullAccessGroup”. Attaches to this group the following rights:

AdministratorAccess
AmazonEKSClusterPolicy
After these steps, AWS will provide you a Secret Access Key and Access Key ID. Save them preciously because this will be the only time AWS gives it to you.

In your own console, create a ~/.aws/credentials file and put your credentials in it:
credentials file:
[default]
 aws_access_key_id=***********
 aws_secret_access_key=****************************
 
 The last step is to create this file:
 config file:
 [default]
 region=eu-west-3
